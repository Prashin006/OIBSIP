### This repository contains five Machine Learning projects which I made as a Data Science Intern at @Oasis InfoByte
### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
##### Dataset: Iris.csv
The Iris dataset contains four features for 50 samples of three species of Iris: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. 
##### Model: Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method that uses the sigmoid function(also known as the logistic function) to find relationships between data factors. It uses these relationships to predict the value of one factor based on the other. Logistic regression can be used for both classification and profiling.
